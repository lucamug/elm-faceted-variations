# Elm Faceted Variations

## [Demo with Time-traveling Debugger](https://lucamug.github.io/elm-faceted-variations/)

## How it works

Check out [the full writeup](https://medium.com/@l.mugnaini/faceted-variants-in-elm-c38b4d661355)!

## Getting started

If you don't already have `elm` and `elm-live`:

```
$ npm install -g elm elm-live
```

Then, to build everything:

```
$ elm-live src/main.elm --open --debug
```

(Leave off the `--debug` if you don't want the time-traveling debugger.)
