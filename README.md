# Elm Faceted Variations

## [Demo with Time-traveling Debugger]()

## How it works

Check out [the full writeup]()!

## Getting started

If you don't already have `elm` and `elm-live`:

```
$ npm install -g elm elm-live
```

Then, to build everything:

```
$ elm-live src/main.elm --open --debug
```

(Leave off the `--debug` if you don't want the time-traveling debugger.)

## To deploy

```
$ cd build
$ surge
```
